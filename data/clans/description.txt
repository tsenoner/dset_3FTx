description:
CLANS is a Java program for visualizing the relationship between proteins based on their all-against-all pairwise sequence similarities.
The program implements a version of the Fruchterman-Reingold force directed graph layout algorithm.
Vertices represent sequences. Edges represent BLAST/PSIBLAST high scoring segment pairs (HSPs).
Colors = cysteine_group
    Long-chain - orange
    Ly-6 - neon green
    Non-standard - odd green
    Plesiotypic - blue
    Short-chain - purple
    pre-3FTx - pink

settings:
- clustered in 2D
- use p-value better than 1e-5
- 10.000 rounds (converged already at 4000 rounds).
